# XYZ Clothing

Bootstrapped on the template project for the super lean [nano-react-app](https://github.com/adrianmcli/nano-react-app).

Clone the repo and cd into the `xyz-clothing` directory.

`yarn` to install dependencies.

`yarn start` will spawn a development server with a default port of `1234`.

`yarn build` will output a production build in the `dist` directory.

`yarn test` will run unit tests.
